PART-A

Program

1  Write a program to sort frames using appropriate sorting techniques.

2  Write a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16-bits).

3  Write a program to find the shortest path between vertices using bellman-ford algorithm.

4.

Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client-server program to make the client send the file name and to make the server send back the contents of the requested file if present.

5. Write a program on datagram socket for client/server to display the messages on client side, typed at the server side.

6.

Write a program for simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the data.

7.

Write a program for congestion control using leaky bucket algorithm.

8.

9.

Write a program to implement Random Early Detection (RED) congestion control algorithm. Write a program for controlling the congestion by implementing token bucket algorithm

PART-B: Simulation

10. Implement three nodes point-to-point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped by iterating for at least 5 sets of values.

11.

Implement transmission of ping messages/trace route over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion

12.

Implement an Ethernet LAN using n nodes, set multiple traffic nodes, and plot congestion window for different source/destination.

13

. Implement simple ESS and with transmitting nodes in wire-less LAN by simulation and determine the performance with respect to transmission of packets
